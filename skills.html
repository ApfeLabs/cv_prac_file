	<p>
		I have to admit. I suck at programming. Just being honest but after dozens of online courses and tutorials, I never quite got the gist of it. Usually everything goes along swimmingly and then, <strong>BAM!</strong> out of nowhere a bug you haaven't been taught to understand brings you to a grinding halt. Or the lessons go from beginner to super dynamic advanced theoretical physics or something else I don't understand.
