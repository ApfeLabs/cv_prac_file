	<h3>My Skills...Sorta.</h3>
	
	<h1>In the Beginning...</h1>
	<p>
		I have to admit. I suck at programming. Just being honest but after dozens of online courses and tutorials, I never quite got the gist of it. Usually everything goes along swimmingly and then, <strong>BAM!</strong> out of nowhere a bug you haven't been taught to understand brings you to a grinding halt. Or the lessons go from beginner to super dynamic advanced theoretical physics or something else I don't understand. There has to be a better way and I intend to find it.
	</p>
	<p>
		As of the writing of this page these are my approximate skill levels, nothing to brag about, to be sure, but I will improve...even if it kills me.
	</p>
	<p>And with that I give you my skills...</p>
